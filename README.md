# RISC-V CPU
The goal of this project is to implement the RISC-V ISA to create a working microprocessor. I will use the DE-10 Altera board and the implementation found in the book Computer Organization and Design by Patterson and Hennessey. The first major milestone to be set is to implement a subset of the main RISC-V ISA, as found in chapter three of the book.
## A working log
In this section, I will document my progress, my thought process, and bi-weekly goals to be set.
